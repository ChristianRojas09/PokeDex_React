This a modern PokeDex app using React, PokeAPI and Material UI. It contains all Pokemon from generation 8 and below.

As a long time Pokemon fan, I wanted to build an app where I could access the different Pokemon and their basic information. I use this application when playing the video games or trading card game. 

I learned a lot with this app. It was my first time taking data from an API - which provided it's own challenges. I used Axios to send the apps requests to the correct API endpoints. Fortunately, PokeAPI is well-documented and was easy to work. 

I used the Material UI component library for this project, and while I did enjoy using it I have found others that I would use over MUI (ShadCN is quite good).

This a modern PokeDex using React, PokeAPI and Material UI. It contains all Pokemon from generation 8 and below.

This app serves to display all Pokemon on the homepage. Users can click into each pokemon's profile by clicking the information icon.
The profile page will display each Pokemon's summary, abilities, size, and evolution chain.
