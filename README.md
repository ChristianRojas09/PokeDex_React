This a modern PokeDex app using React, PokeAPI and Material UI. It contains all Pokemon from generation 8 and below.

As a long time Pokemon fan, I wanted to build an app where I could access the different Pokemon and their basic information. I use this application when playing the video games or trading card game. 

I learned a lot with this app. It was my first time taking data from an API - which provided it's own challenges. I used Axios to send the apps requests to the correct API endpoints. Fortunately, PokeAPI is well-documented and was easy to work. 

I used the Material UI component library for this project, and while I did enjoy using it I have found others that I would use over MUI (ShadCN is quite good).
